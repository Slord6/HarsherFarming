# HarsherFarming

A lightweight Minecraft datapack that makes farming more difficult.

## Crops

- Wheat
- Beetroot
- Carrot
- Potato

## Effects

- Crops harvested in cold biomes produce no items
- Crops harvested in hot biomes (desert, badlands) can only be harvested when it is 'raining'
- Number of seeds per crop reduced:
    - Rather than a ~0.6x chance of up to 3 extra seeds you now have a 0.1x chance of 1 extra seed
