# HarsherFarming

A lightweight Minecraft datapack that makes farming more difficult.

## Crops

- Wheat
- Beetroot
- Carrot
- Potato


### Effects

- Crops harvested in cold biomes produce no items
- Crops harvested in hot biomes (desert, badlands) can only be harvested when it is 'raining'
- Number of seeds per crop reduced:
    - Rather than a ~0.6x chance of up to 3 extra seeds you now have a 0.1x chance of 1 extra seed 


## Meat & Fish

- Fishing Rods:
    - Only work in Ocean & River biomes
    - 50/50 chance as to whether a caught fish actually causes an uncooked fish to spawn
- Cows/Pigs/Rabbits/Sheep/Chicken
    - 0.2x chance to get 1 meat per animal


## Other blocks

- Grass and tall grass have decreased drop rates for wheat seeds
